    Let's take a look at an example of how to find a city on the map using the template matching with mobility data.
    The activity can be visualized as a heatmap (marker&nbsp;<em>a</em>), where the low activity areas are dark blue and the high activity areas are yellow with a gradual transition.
    To make the template matching step a bit easier, let's use a 'binary' image, with two colors (marker&nbsp;<em>c</em>).
    We can find a threshold where the low and high activity levels are separated (check out the histogram, marker&nbsp;<em>b</em>).
    This gives us a "binary" template, similar to the activity example we saw before.
    But here's where it gets a little different from the explanation figure below, the two colors should match the map characteristics.
    Now, let's use dark blue for the water and yellow for the land.
    By simplifying the figures colors-wise.
    It's important to keep in mind that the template and the map should be generated in the same <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection">projection</a>.
    The template matching works on images, and the result is a relative location (marker&nbsp;<em>d</em>) of the template image in the large image.
    This relative location can be used to determine the geographical coordinates using the map data and the applied projection.
