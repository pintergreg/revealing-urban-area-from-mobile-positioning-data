    Let's see an example to the template matching using mobility data.
    The activity can be visualized as a heatmap (marker&nbsp;<em>a</em>), in this case the low activity areas are dark blue and the high activity areas are yellow with a gradual transition.
    To simplify the template matching step, let's use a 'binary' image, with two colors (marker&nbsp;<em>c</em>).
    A threshold can be found where the low and high activity level is separated (see the histogram, marker&nbsp;<em>b</em>).
    Then we have a 'binary' template, similar to the activity example before.
    Unlike the explanation figure below, the two colors should be selected to match the image (the map). For example water could be dark blue and the land yellow.
    By simplifying the figures colors-wise.
    Naturally, the template and the map should be generated in the same projection.
    As the template matching works on images, the result is a relative location (marker&nbsp;<em>d</em>) of the template image in the large image.
    This relative location can be used to determine the geographical coordinates using the map data and the applied projection.
