    Next, we define the Barrier Crossing Ratio (BCR) index for different Louvain resolution values (&gamma;), which measures the relationship between those trips that cross barriers and those that cross barriers and communities as well.
    We calculate the fraction of barrier and community crosses among all barrier crossings (separately by barrier types of <i>districts</i>, <i>neighborhoods</i>, <i>primary roads</i>, <i>secondary roads</i>, <i>railways</i>, and <i>rivers</i>), and take the inverse of this ratio.
    Since the number of barrier crossings is constant to the resolution, and the size of the communities are decreasing as the resolution is increased, the BCR also decreases as the resolution is increased.
