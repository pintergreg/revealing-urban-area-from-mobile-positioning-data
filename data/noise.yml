    Adding some noise to the data could be a great way to improve the individual privacy, while keeping the higher-level mobility trends intact.
    Here are some possible ways to do this: (i) randomly displace a number of observed locations of an individual by a given radius, or (ii) randomly include fictional locations into the trajectories or randomly remove locations.
    The tricky part is figuring out the right level of randomness for the noise, but that's a topic for another day.

    The figures show what happens when random noise is added to every location point (in the Toronto data) with 1 km deviation.
    Blue squares represent cells where there were no activity before the noise addition, red cells lost their activity due to the activity relocation, and black cells had activity before and after the noise effect.

    In the world of computer vision, the noise is like a blurring effect that removes the details, but keeps the general shape of the city, as long as the "blur" is applied within reasonable limits (without the intent of completely destroying the data).
    The template matching isn't affected much by some noise, and the city location can still be revealed, but individuals might be less traceable.
