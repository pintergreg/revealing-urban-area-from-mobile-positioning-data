    Have you ever thought about how the way people are spread out in a city can tell us a lot about that city's landscape?
    If enough location data is available, the geographic distribution of the appearances will describe the urban area quite well.
    Let's take a look at some examples of cities like Toronto, London, Helsinki, and Dallas-Fort Worth.
    Here, we can see mobile positioning data in pink (MPD) and landuse data from the OpenStreetMap in green (OSM).
