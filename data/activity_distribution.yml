    Have you ever thought about how the way people are spread out in a city can tell us a lot about that city's landscape?
    If enough location data is available, the geographic distribution of the appearances (activities) will describe the urban area quite well.
    Let's take a look at some examples of cities like Toronto, London, Helsinki, and Dallas-Fort Worth.
    Here, we can see mobile positioning data in pink (MPD) and landuse data from the OpenStreetMap in green (OSM).
    The MPD is shown as 250-by-250-meter cells. If someone used their phone in a cell, it'll show up as pink.
    The map data (OSM) shows among others residential and industrial areas, but not parks, lakes, and so on.
    People like to spend some time in parks, so it's no surprise that the two are a bit different, but the overall shape is pretty similar.
