    There is a trade-off between publishing mobility data for research purposes while protecting the privacy of the individuals.
    Concealing the geographic location does not help, completely removing the location information makes data basically unusable for urban planning, for example.
    Aggregating the locations into rasters, for example, with 100 m × 100 m, 500 m × 500 m sides or even larger sizes can limit the accuracy of the location.
    However, at a city-scale this has to be significant aggregation to have effect, because as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376">research by de Montjoye et al.</a> showed that a user stands out from the crowd, if the top four locations (e.g., home and work locations and two frequent location from the commuting route) are distinguishable.
    So, the spatial aggregation has to be strong enough to hide the differences between the four most frequently visited locations, which will inherently decrease the usefulness of the data.
