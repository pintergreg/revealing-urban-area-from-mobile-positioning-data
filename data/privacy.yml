    You might think that hiding the geographic location of mobility data is a good way to protect the users' privacy, when mobility data is published.
    But, publishing location data always comes with some privacy risks.
    This is especially true when additional information is available for an individual, such as their location at a specific time, which could potentially lead to their identification.
    Take, for example, the article in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/20/opinion/location-data-national-security.html"> New York Times article</a> by Stuart A. Thompson and Charlie Warzel about the president of the United States.

# But the trajectories that show where people are going every day could also identify them, especially with extra info, like where famous people were at a certain time.
# Anonymization is one thing, getting rid of unique identifiers (like phone numbers and email addresses) from the data is an obvious step.
# This is more likely to happen with well-known people who have a lot of attention on their whereabouts.
