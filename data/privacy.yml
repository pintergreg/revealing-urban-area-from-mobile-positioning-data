    The idea behind concealing the geographic location of mobility data could be to protect the users' privacy in the data.
    Exposing location data always comes with a certain level of privacy risks.
    Anonimization is one thing, removing unique identifiers (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses) from the data is an obvious step.
