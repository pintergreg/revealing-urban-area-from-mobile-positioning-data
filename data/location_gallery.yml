    It might seem a good idea to conceal the geographic location to protect the users in the data.
    However, if concealing only means transforming the coordinates to an obscure plane, than that won't solve the underlying issue.
    Since the geographic distribution of human mobility is characterizes well the urban landscape, it will be possible to locate the observation area on the map.
    <br>The only challenge could be to deduce the applied transformation.
